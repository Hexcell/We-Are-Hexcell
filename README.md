# Hex what?
Ever since I can remember, I always wanted to create something big, I wanted to help people and make impossible things possible.
Here it is, my attempt to create a community to make the world a better place.
And everyone is invited. I chose the name `Hexcell`, because I like the words Hexagon and Cell.

# What do we do?
We plan awesome projects, work together and inspire people.
We want to have a big team of great people to make things that wouldn't be possible to make alone.

# What can I do?
Join the community. Everyone is invited, you don't have to be specialized in anything, we need you.

# How to join the community
Talk to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/zSfmaSZ).
